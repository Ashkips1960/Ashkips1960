# Hi there, I'm Ashford Kipleting  

I'm a backend developer who enjoys working with Java, Python, and R. My main interest is in data science, especially building backend systems that process, analyze, and deliver meaningful insights. I like working behind the scenes — writing clean code, optimizing performance, and making sure everything runs smoothly.

 I'm always exploring new ways to use data and automation to solve real-world problems. I’m open to collaboration, learning, and building tools that make a difference.
